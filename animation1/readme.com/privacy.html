Company will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.\n\nIf there are any conflicts this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict.

The information we receive will depend on the policies and your account settings with the third party service.\n* **Information from our advertising partners:** We receive information about you from some of our service providers who assist us with marketing or promotional services related to how you interact with our websites, applications, products, services, advertisements or communications.  \n\n### Information we automatically collect when you use our Services:\nSome Personal Data is automatically collected when you use our Services, such as the following: \n* IP address\n* Device identifiers \n* Web browser information\n* Page view statistics\n* Browsing history\n* Usage information\n* Cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixel tags, SDKs, etc.)\n* Location information (e.g. IP address, zip code) \n* Log data (e.g. access times, hardware and software information)\n\n### Third Party Analytic Tools\nOur Services may use third party analytic tools, such as Google Analytics, that use cookies, web beacons, or other similar information gathering technologies to collect standard internet log information and usage information.  The information generated is used to compile statistical reports on user activity.  We will never (and will not allow any third party to) use the statistical reports to track or to collect any personal information of visitors to, or users of, our Services. We will not associate any information gathered from the statistical reports with any personal information from any source.
