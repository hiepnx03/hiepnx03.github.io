WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:04.064
[MARY] This is a virtual tour of the office!

00:04.084 --> 00:09.089
So, this is the front area—it’s kind of messy because no one has been here in weeks.

00:10.399 --> 00:14.569
And, we got a plant wall that needs to grow into itself.

00:14.583 --> 00:20.723
This is the Roost in the front. Eventually we will hold events here.

00:20.752 --> 00:26.347
But, umm, right now no events can happen anywhere—so not today.

00:26.575 --> 00:30.210
And then this is the main work area where everyone sits.

00:30.380 --> 00:35.430
Dom’s in the middle, Marc’s at the end, Rafe sits over here.

00:35.690 --> 00:41.725
And it’s an open area. Eventually you will be able to come here.

00:42.004 --> 00:44.839
And then we have three conference rooms.

00:44.922 --> 00:47.342
This is the first one. We’ve got gorgeous wallpaper.

00:47.721 --> 00:52.906
And they are named after the streets that our offices have been on.

00:52.996 --> 00:57.311
And then we added in colors because no one could remember which room was which.

00:57.388 --> 00:58.048
So…

00:58.055 --> 01:00.055
This is the green room.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.295
This is the yellow room, slash Kearny.

01:02.310 --> 01:05.370
I’ve set up camp in here.

01:05.410 --> 01:08.785
Oh! These are lithographs from all of our offsites.

01:11.235 --> 01:16.390
Owlbert going around the United States and world.

01:17.496 --> 01:18.911
Aannndddd…

01:20.141 --> 01:23.411
Yeah, I’ll try to speed it up ‘cause now this is getting long.

01:23.603 --> 01:24.573
Um, this is the final-

01:24.581 --> 01:26.846
Look at those plants. Look at that light.

01:27.846 --> 01:33.201
And then this is the kitchen area. We have team lunches over here.

01:33.764 --> 01:35.084
Kitchen…

01:35.109 --> 01:35.679
…space!

01:35.724 --> 01:39.364
For all the snacks. Right now snack supply is running low.

01:39.550 --> 01:42.005
We’ve got a phone booth for calls.

01:42.115 --> 01:45.505
And then a hang out area. And the restrooms in the back.

01:45.545 --> 01:47.095
We have a Switch.

01:47.385 --> 01:48.060
YEAH

01:48.082 --> 01:54.032
And, um, overall there are a bazillion owls in the office.

01:54.678 --> 01:56.678
As you will see.

01:56.985 --> 02:00.980
Polaroids from, like, all of the million things we’ve done.

02:00.986 --> 02:02.986
We did, like, painting these owls.

02:02.985 --> 02:05.520
And then the ReadMe values.

02:05.558 --> 02:07.558
Yeah. So that's the office.

02:07.805 --> 02:10.130
Can’t wait to have you come here in person.
